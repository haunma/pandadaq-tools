pandadaq-tools:  Support software for the PandaDAQ board
--------------------------------------------------------

pdaq_lib/    Support for programming the Spartan-6 FPGA via i2c/spi


Requirements
------------

pdaq_lib/ has nearly no external dependencies. However, it does require that
the libi2c headers are installed (e.g., in the case of Ubuntu, libi2c-dev).
Failure to install these headers will open the possibility for kernel headers
to be included which can lead to rather confusing build failures.
